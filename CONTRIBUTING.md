We are creating a registry of public places that play absolutely no music.
While we have been known to tolerate, even love, NYC establishments which play soft classical or jazz (e.g. Caf√©
Sabarsky, Elephant & Castle, North Square, &c.) they are not candidates for places quiet.

Our goals are shared by [pipedown.info](http://pipedown.info) who fight the plague of
"piped music", a term referring to unwanted background music. Whether a bar
is filled with human voices or the sounds of a busy nearby road, it is still
a "place quiet" in the sense that it does not subject patrons or employees to
piped music.

Please help out by sharing quiet places with us via [pull
requests](https://github.com/aupiff/places-quiet/issues/new) on our github repo
or by sending a note to blankman@boustro.com. For each location you suggest,
please include the last time you visited.
