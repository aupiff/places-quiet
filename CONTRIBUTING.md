We are creating a registry of public places that play absolutely no music.
While we have been known to tolerate, even love, NYC establishments like Caf√©
Sbarsky, Elephant & Castle, or North Square, all of which play quiet classical
or jazz, they are not candidates for places quiet.

Our goals are shared with similar websites like
[pipedown.info](http://pipedown.info) who say they are fighting the plague of
"piped music". Whether a bar is filled with human voices or the sounds of
a busy nearby road, it is still a "place quiet" in the sense that it does not
subject patrons or employees to piped music.

Please help out by sharing quiet places with us via [pull
requests](https://github.com/aupiff/places-quiet/issues/new) on our github repo
or by sending a note to riblankman@gmail.com. For each location you suggest,
please include the last time you visited.
