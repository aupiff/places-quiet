<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>We are creating a registry of public places that play absolutely no music.
While we have been known to tolerate, even love, NYC establishments which play soft classical or jazz (e.g. Café
Sabarsky, Elephant &amp; Castle, North Square, &c.) they are not candidates for places quiet.</p>
<p>Our goals are shared by
<a href="http://pipedown.info" rel="nofollow">pipedown.info</a> who fight the plague of
"piped music", a term referring to unwanted background music. Whether a bar
is filled with human voices or the sounds of a busy nearby road, it is still
a "place quiet" in the sense that it does not subject patrons or employees to
piped music.</p>
<p>Please help out by sharing quiet places with us via <a href="https://github.com/aupiff/places-quiet/issues/new">pull
requests</a> on our github repo
or by sending a note to <a href="mailto:blankman@boustro.com">blankman@boustro.com</a>. For each location you suggest,
please include the last time you visited.</p>
