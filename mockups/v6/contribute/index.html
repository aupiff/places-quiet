<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>We are creating a registry of public places that play absolutely no music.
While we have been known to tolerate, even love, NYC establishments like Café
Sbarsky, Elephant &amp; Castle, or North Square, all of which play quiet classical
or jazz, they are not candidates for places quiet.</p>
<p>Our goals are shared with similar websites like
<a href="http://pipedown.info" rel="nofollow">pipedown.info</a> who say they are fighting the plague of
"piped music". Whether a bar is filled with human voices or the sounds of
a busy nearby road, it is still a "place quiet" in the sense that it does not
subject patrons or employees to piped music.</p>
<p>Please help out by sharing quiet places with us via <a href="https://github.com/aupiff/places-quiet/issues/new">pull
requests</a> on our github repo
or by sending a note to <a href="mailto:riblankman@gmail.com">riblankman@gmail.com</a>. For each location you suggest,
please include the last time you visited.</p>
